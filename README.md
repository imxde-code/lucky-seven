# Lucky Seven™ — Online Multiplayer Card Game

A real-time multiplayer card game for 2-8 players, built by Kamal Hazriq. Hosted on GitHub Pages with Firebase as the backend. Lowest score wins — and Sevens are worth zero!

## Game Rules

- **Deck**: 52 standard cards + 2 Jokers = 54 cards
- **Deal**: 3 cards face-down per player. You cannot look at your own cards (unless you peek)
- **On your turn**:
  1. **Draw** from the draw pile (only you see it) OR take the top discard card (visible to all)
  2. **Swap** the drawn card with one of your 3 face-down cards, **discard** it, or **use its power**
- **Scoring**: Ace=1, 2-6=face value, **7=0**, 8-10=face value, J/Q/K/Joker=10
- **Winner**: Lowest score wins. Tiebreaker: most 7s.

### Power Cards

| Card | Power | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Jack** | Peek | Secretly look at one of your own face-down cards |
| **Queen** | Swap | Swap any two unlocked cards between any players |
| **King** | Lock | Lock any unlocked card — it cannot be swapped |
| **10** | Key | Unlock a locked card |
| **Joker** | Chaos | Randomly shuffle another player's unlocked cards |

When you use a power card, it gets discarded after the effect resolves. You can always choose to swap or discard a power card instead of using its ability.

### Lock Mechanics

- Locked cards show a red lock icon and **cannot** be swapped (by you, Queen, or Joker).
- A Joker's Chaos only shuffles the target player's **unlocked** cards.
- Use a 10 (Key) to unlock any locked card.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore real-time database + Anonymous Auth)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static)

## Setup

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (disable Google Analytics if you want)
3. Go to **Build > Firestore Database** and create a database (start in **test mode** for now)
4. Go to **Build > Authentication > Sign-in method** and enable **Anonymous** sign-in
5. Go to **Project Settings > General** and scroll to "Your apps"
6. Click **Add app** > **Web** (</>) and register your app
7. Copy the Firebase config values

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your Firebase config values in `.env`:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 3. Deploy Firestore Security Rules

Copy the contents of `firestore.rules` into your Firebase Console:

1. Go to **Firestore Database > Rules**
2. Replace the default rules with the contents of `firestore.rules`
3. Click **Publish**

Or use the Firebase CLI:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init firestore  # select your project
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 4. Create a Firestore Index

The join-by-code feature requires a composite index. Create it in Firebase Console:

1. Go to **Firestore Database > Indexes**
2. Click **Add Index** (Composite)
3. Collection: `games`
4. Fields: `joinCode` (Ascending), `status` (Ascending)
5. Query scope: Collection
6. Click **Create**

Alternatively, the first time you try to join a game by code, Firebase will show an error with a direct link to create the index automatically.

### 5. Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/lucky-seven/

### 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages (Automatic via GitHub Actions)

Deployment is fully automated. Every push to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys to GitHub Pages.

**One-time setup:**

1. Go to your GitHub repo **Settings > Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment", set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
3. Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**
4. Add these **Repository secrets** (values from your `.env` file):

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Your Firebase API key |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | `your-project.firebaseapp.com` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Your Firebase project ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | `your-project.firebasestorage.app` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Your sender ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Your Firebase app ID |

5. Go to **Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains**
6. Add `<your-username>.github.io` to the authorized domains list

After setup, every `git push origin main` will auto-deploy. You can also trigger a manual deploy from the **Actions** tab using "Run workflow".

**Your live URL will be:** `https://<your-username>.github.io/lucky-seven/`

> **Note:** The app uses `HashRouter` so all routes work correctly on GitHub Pages without a custom 404 page. URLs look like `https://user.github.io/lucky-seven/#/game/abc123`.

## Multi-Game Concurrency

Multiple games can run simultaneously without interference:

- **Game isolation**: All data lives under `games/{gameId}/` — each game has its own players, private hands, draw pile, and reveals subcollections. There is zero shared mutable state between games.
- **Scoped subscriptions**: The `useGame` hook subscribes only to the specific `gameId` from the URL. Navigating between games cleanly unsubscribes/resubscribes.
- **Unique join codes**: 6-character alphanumeric codes (36^6 = ~2.2 billion possibilities). On creation, the code is verified to be unique among active lobby games with automatic retry (up to 5 attempts).
- **Transaction safety**: All game-mutating operations (draw, swap, discard, powers, cancel draw, call end) use Firestore transactions scoped to a single `games/{gameId}` document tree, preventing race conditions.
- **Anonymous auth**: Each browser tab gets its own anonymous UID. A player can have multiple tabs open in different games simultaneously.

## Security Model

- **Anonymous Auth**: Players sign in automatically, no account needed
- **Turn validation**: Game actions use Firestore transactions to enforce turn order and rules
- **Action versioning**: Every action increments `actionVersion` to prevent double-applies
- **Private data**: Hand contents stored in `private/{playerId}` docs. Client-side only subscribes to own private doc. Cross-player reads happen within server-side Firestore transactions (for Queen swap and Joker chaos powers).
- **No card leaking in UI**: Only draw pile count and discard top are shown publicly. Other players' cards are face-down.
- **Reveal pattern**: At game end, each player writes their own hand to `reveals/{playerId}` so results can be displayed without cross-player private reads.

## Quota Notes (Firebase Free Tier)

Lucky Seven is designed to run comfortably within Firebase's free Spark plan.

### Write Budget per Game

| Action | Writes | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Turn action (draw/swap/discard/power) | 2-4 | Game doc + private doc(s) |
| Chat message | 1 | Single doc in `chat` subcollection |
| Presence update | 1 | Throttled to 1 write per 60 seconds |
| Game summary (on finish) | 2 | Summary doc + global stats counter |

**Typical 4-player game (~40 turns):** ~120-160 writes total.

### Safeguards

- **Bounded logs**: Game log capped at 50 entries; older entries pruned on each write.
- **Chat limit**: Query limited to last 50 messages (`orderBy ts desc, limit 50`).
- **Presence throttle**: Connection writes throttled to once per 60s. Disconnects always write immediately.
- **Lazy chat subscription**: Mobile users don't subscribe to chat until they open the panel. Desktop subscribes after first render (not on component mount).
- **Single discard top**: Only the current discard card is stored (no discard history array).
- **One summary per game**: Analytics written once by host when all players reveal.
- **No polling**: All real-time updates use Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners (server push), not client polling.

### Scaling Estimates (Spark Plan: 50K reads / 20K writes per day)

| Scale | Games/Day | Est. Writes/Day | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| ~50 games | 50 | ~8K | Comfortable on free tier |
| ~200 games | 200 | ~32K | Approaching limit, consider Blaze |
| ~500+ games | 500+ | ~80K+ | Requires Blaze (pay-as-you-go) |
